Title：
1002 A+B for Polynomials (25)（25 分）

Question：
This time, you are supposed to find A+B where A and B are two polynomials.

Input：
Each input file contains one test case. Each case occupies 2 lines, and each line contains the information of a polynomial: K N1 a~N1~ N2 a~N2~ ... NK a~NK~, where K is the number of nonzero terms in the polynomial, Ni and a~Ni~ (i=1, 2, ..., K) are the exponents and coefficients, respectively. It is given that 1 <= K <= 10，0 <= NK < ... < N2 < N1 <=1000.

Output：
For each test case you should output the sum of A and B in one line, with the same format as the input. Notice that there must be NO extra space at the end of each line. Please be accurate to 1 decimal place.

Sample Input
2 1 2.4 0 3.2
2 2 1.5 1 0.5

Sample Output
3 2 1.5 1 2.9 0 3.2


坑：
在文中给出了要求的格式要求，但是exanple中却没有，
利用map的STL库
可以只用一个map通过读取修改值得方式来减少内存使用
